In Svelte, single file components are created with the .svelte file extension and are comprised of three sections, the script section, the markup (HTML) section, and the style section. Within the script section you can write Javascript that runs when the component instance is created. Meteor already sets up MongoDB for you, and in order to use our database we just need to create a collection. Compared to other technologies that we have used, Meteor & Svelte make it easier to incorporate a backend database to the frintend HTML. It is useful to have both a script and HTML section for each page. Additionally, deploying the app was a lot easier than for previous technologies.
